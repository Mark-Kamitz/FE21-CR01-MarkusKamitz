                            When a woman has a job, it is statistically proven the impact she has on herself and those around her is profound. Behind those statistics, though, are real stories of pain and joy and overcoming. We invite you to read through some of the stories so that you might know them a bit, and that you might find that we all share in common a desire to be known and to be loved.

                            Once, in the early spring, two seeds were dropped not far from a river. One grew into a daisy, with soft white petals and a sunny yellow middle. The other grew into a rose, sweet and graceful, with petals the color of a summer sunset. They grew together, and were the best of friends.

                            One summer day, the rose said to the daisy, "I would like to see the world. I want to travel to faraway places, and see what it's like where other flowers grow."

                            A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.
                            <br>
                            If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river.

                            Love and care for the one you love every single days of your life. You may think what you did is just a small deed, but to that someone, it may mean a lot. Have a nice day everyone! May this story inspire you in any way! I was born in a secluded village on a mountain. Day by day, my parents plowed the yellow dry soil with their backs towards the sky.
